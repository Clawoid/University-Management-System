# University Management System (Python)

A menu-driven **University Management System** developed using **Python** with **CSV files** for persistent data storage.  
The system simulates core academic, administrative, and financial operations within a university environment.

This project was developed during my **first semester** as part of a foundational programming module, with emphasis on **procedural programming, control flow, and file handling**.
